# Hanshi (MWG3_demo)
A handwriting font with full support for Hudum Mongolian, Sibe, Manchu and Manchu Ali Gali

## Features
* Multi-language support: Hanshi is a demo font for Hudum Mongolian (ᠬᠤᠳᠦᠮ᠋ ᠮᠣᠩᠭᠣᠯ), Sibe (ᠰᡳᠪᡝ), Manchu (ᠮᠠᠨᠵᡠ), and Manchu Ali Gali (ᠮᠠᠨᠵᡠ ᠠᠯᡳ ᡬᠠᠯᡳ). It supports phonetically, graphetically, and (Menksoft)-graphically encoded text.
* Handwriting font: Hanshi is a handwriting font, mimicking smooth joining and adjusted kerning in handwriting by means of juncture segmentation and substantial contextual substitutions.
* Proper placement of Manchu (Ali Gali) diacritics: Manchu (Ali Gali) diacritics are properly placed around consonant-vowel junctures instead of just beside consonants or vowels.
* Unbounded gender propagation: Unbounded progressive gender propagation is implemented in this font: ᠠᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠢᠭᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠢᠭᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠢᠭ ᠡᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠢᠭᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠢᠭᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠯᠢᠭ.
* Prompt for illicit strings: Invalid control characters are rendered visible in this font, and it clearly differentiates illicit positional forms from out-of-context forms (segments terminated by ZWJs) or abbreviations (segments terminated by nirugus): *s* = ᠰ, *s*+`ZWJ` = ᠰ‍, *s*+`nirugu` = ᠰ᠊; *bey* = ᠪᠡᠶ (halfway in typing *bey_e* ᠪᠡᠶ᠎ᠡ).
